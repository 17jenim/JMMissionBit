	<h1>You chose The left</h1>
</head>
<p>You both run to the left towards the rock music. </p>

<p>You stumble upon a huge concert. You and your friend get separated in the crowd and cant find each other. You can either dig your way through the mass of sweaty people or you can find your own way out and run, leaving your best friend behind.</p>

<p>Which way do you go?</p>
