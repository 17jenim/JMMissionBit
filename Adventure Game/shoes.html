<p>you chose the love of your life! you both escape to safety and run towards something shining in the distance. It turns out that it is a peice of glass on the beach. Except you are running so fast that you can't stop. You run over the peice of glass impaling it in your foot. You fall and the love of your life wants to either stay with you and wait for help or leave you there in a hiding spot and go run to find you help. </p>

<p>Which do you choose?</p>
