	<h1>You chose Your best friend</h1>
</head>
<p>You grab your best friend and run towards your way of escape. </p>

<p>You Make it through to saftey and still run anyway. You see a fork in the road up ahead. You hear soft twinkelly music coming from the right. And loud rocker music coming from the left. </p>

<p>Which way do you go?</p>
