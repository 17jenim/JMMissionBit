<p>You send him off to get help. In the meantime you rip the glass out intending to wrap your foot in a peice of your shirt you just tore off. But before you can a vampire bat screeches as it swoops down. You move your hands from your foot frantically waving around your head trying to shoo the bat away. While your foot is longer gaurded the bat dives and bites your foot, not letting go. Instead it starts sucking your blood and you start to get dizzy and everything gets blurry. you start to sway, and eventually you fall back slowly having the life drained out of you. The last thing you see is the love of your life running towards you with tears in his eyes. then it all goes black.</p>
