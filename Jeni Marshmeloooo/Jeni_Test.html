  <p>I want mcdoanlds. it makes my tummy happy. I want food and it needs to be junk food. Maybe burger King. Or In and out. In and out is the best burgers ever mostly because of their cheese. Popeyes has the best fries so if popeyes and burger king got together and joined their burgers and their fries then they would rule the world!</p>
